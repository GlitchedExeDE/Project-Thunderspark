			<h2>What is Project Thunderspark?</h2>

			<p id="para1">
			Project Thunderspark is a web-based application that aims to bring GlitchedExe's fictional universe, "The Zone" to life by 
			complying all the information that had been worked on over the years into a single compendium.
			If you're interested in a sci-fi, dark, war-focused ever-growing universe which spans multiple timelines and centuries, that took inspiration from fiction such as Warhammer, STALKER, SCP. Then you're looking right at it.

				<p id="para1">
				Project Thunderspark is the first official attempt to create a web-based locally-stored application for storing information about GlitchedExe's "The Zone."
				</p>
				<p id="para1">
				This is by no means the finished product, and updates will be released through a series of update folders that the user would have to search, 
				download and apply manually. Any feedback and discussion are highly encouraged by the creator. Thank you for your support and patience :)
