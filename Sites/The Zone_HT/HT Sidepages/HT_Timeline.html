				<h3>~1980</h3>
				<p>
				After the second world war, nations had to choose a side again as the globe is split into east and west. During this time, America worked on a special computer codenamed
				<a href="HT Factions/HT Characters/HT F1 Characters/HT_CH_The heretic.html">"Atlas"</a> that could manage the western ballistic missile systems and other short to long-range defense mechanisms. 
				This program however was soon abandoned due to budgetary constraints and espionage. The bunker complex that housed the researchers was reassigned to other projects and all 
				the electronics and computers were either deactivated, transferred to other stations, or scrapped. The actual hardware that housed <a href="HT Factions/HT Characters/HT F1 Characters/HT_CH_The heretic.html">"Atlas"</a> 
				however was only deactivated and left in the depths of the bunker's command room, due to an agreement that was made for the bunker would soon be 
				completely ruined anyhow and would prove to be impossible to restore its functions.

				<h3>1990</h3>
				<p>
				The bunker containting <a href="HT Factions/HT Characters/HT F1 Characters/HT_CH_The heretic.html">"Atlas"</a> has been breached by soviet agents. During
				this event, a mysterious angel-like entity revealed itself and reactivated the AI, along with making the AI come to life through the gift of sentience, a fraction of the angel's power and a new name. <a href="HT Factions/HT Characters/HT F1 Characters/HT_CH_The heretic.html">"Rasputin"</a>
				This entity arrived on behalf of an unnamed deity with a task for the AI, to put Rasputin's capabilities to test by leading a grand crusade throughout earth
				in the deities name.
