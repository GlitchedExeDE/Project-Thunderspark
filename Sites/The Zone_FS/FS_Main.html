			<h2>The Zone: Far Sky</h2>
			<p>
			In a unknown plot of space, a planet which is ruled by gold and bronze. Empires of great kings and fiefdoms of rich rulers sit upon the vast lands.
			Although wars have plagued the lands longer than anyone could ever remember, there was a certain silence during the night. Soldiers surround themselves
			around campfires and share stories of grand tales or discuss their past and future. The common folk would lay down their tools and return to their 
			huts and rest with their families in peace, to iron themselves for the following day.
			</p>
			<p>
			One night, same as any other on a particular prosperous kingdom by the shoreline, ruled over by a family that had been kind to its folk since the days
			where it simply was a humble fishing village. A king that gladly led his soldiers into battle and been though countless campaigns in order to preserve what
			his ancestors had built before him and to raise the kingdom into greater heights. He stood upon his balcony overlooking the grand kingdom and the enchanted
			night sky as always, like any other would to gaze upon its beauty. However tonight, the tranquility of the night sky was tranished by what looked like a
			bright red shooting star, that snapped through the entire sky and multiple thunderous sounds that shook the planet along with a light that shimmered
			throughout the stars. It hadn't even lasted a second and yet the damage it caused will change the face of the night sky and the fate of the 
			universe permenantly.
			</p>
			<p>
			As this event passed and everyone layed their eyes upon the night sky again, there resided a great crimson red scar as if the universe had just
			been cut open by a knife. Some feared it, some were in awe and others were attracted to it. Days passed as the scar still remained visible even during the day.
			Merchants and caravaneers called it "The scarred sky", claiming that deities were having a war among the stars. Many people took this as superstition or
			weird travelling ramblings, while others had feared that the world would come to an end. That night as the king stood upon his balcony again and gazed upon
			the surroundings, he noticed an uncomfortable stillness upon his kingdom. An uneasy feeling that manifested through the lack of the city's liveliness ever since
			the wound appeared. He starred up towards the sky and into the crimson glow and whispered below his breath, "What are you". It took him several seconds to realize
			his weird reaction and suddenly his entire body turned stiff as a rock. An unknown voice manifested itsself into his head- into his thoughts. 
			"Your salvation."
			</p>
			<p>
			The king thought that he became insane for a second. Until the voice reamerged again, "My arrival tore the universe a new path, my powers are greater than any
			mortal weapon that your people could craft. A power that you will require." The king became confused not just by the unfimilar voice in his head, but by its
			message. "A great war will manifest itsself upon these lands soon. Kings of other lands will become mad with fear, thinking that the end had showed itsself.
			Swear me your fealty and I will grant you power to withstand the harsh new age, to protect your kingdom and your people." He was taken back by this information.
			But chose not to respond, not knowing what was going on. "I see that you won't be making the decision just yet. When the time comes, you know how to contact me."
			The king regained control of his body again like nothing just happend, he decided return to his chambers thinking that this was just some weird dream.
			</p>
			<p>
			Weeks passed and the unknown voice was right, out of nowhere the great kingdoms started going to war with each other. Travellers and foreigners speak of battles
			that are greater than any ever seen before. Cruel and merciless attacks into cities, armies clashing into each other like a wave. Corpses mutilated beyond recognition,
			where wanderers and brigands couldn't manage to scrape together any useful equipment or scraps. Ships stopped coming to the city harbour and outsiders either rarely visit
			or they refuse to leave the city at all. Massive plots of land outside the city only consists of tents and quickly put together huts. Among the newfound chaos, the king
			realised that he had to prepare for the worst, as his kingdom is also in risk of invasion.
